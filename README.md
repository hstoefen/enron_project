# Enron Project
## Machine Learning Final Project
This project was carried out during the course of a Udacity (www.udacity.com) program called Data Analyst Nanodegree.

During the project, a data set given by Udacity about a spectacular fraud case, the [Enron scandal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron) was used to choose and tune a machine learning algorithm in a way that it finds persons of interest in the data set.

All code was written in python as appropriate.
* [poi_id.py](poi_id.py) contains code that produces the classifier, data set and feature list for validation
* [my_tools.py](my_tools.py) contains code to help make the code reusable and easy to read
* [my_tester.py](my_tester.py) contains a modified tester to assess performance of the algorithms
* the "data story" was told using using a [Jupyter Notebook](final_project.ipynb).
